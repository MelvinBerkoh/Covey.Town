## Hermetic Test
Definition: a hermetic test is fully self-contained: its behavior doesn't depend on anything except the test itself and the SUT.
  -Avoid dependencies on the environment
  -Being hermetic is also important for builds generally

## Brittle test
Definition: a brittle test fails for reasons unrelated to what it ostensibly tests.
  -Common causes:
    -Dependencies on the environment
    -Dependencies on other tests
    -Timing dependencies
    -Order dependencies
    -COmparator or oracle is too specific

## Mystery tests
Definition: a mystery test is one where the purpose of the test is not clear.
  -commonly co-occurs with brittleness: test is brittle because it is too complicated and when it fails its not clear why
  -Best practice: test should give as much information as possible when they fail
    - implication: when writing tests, think about why they might fail in the future and document that in the test itself.

## Flaky test
Definition: a flaky test is one that sometimes passes and sometimes fails, even when nothing has changed
  - Sometimes caused by brittleness
  -Sometimes caused by non-determinism in the program itself

# Test suite quality 
  Definition: a test suite is a collection of test for the same program
