# CS 490 – Individual Project 1: Quantum Tic-Tac-Toe

## Overview

This assignment simulates a starter task you might be given as a junior software engineer joining a team. A senior engineer began implementing a new feature — Quantum Tic-Tac-Toe — but got sick before finishing.

Your job is to:

- Understand the existing Covey.Town codebase
- Complete the unfinished parts of the project
- Write tests to verify your implementation

You are given 2 weeks to complete this assignment. It is estimated to take about 8 hours of focused work. Start early to avoid rushing and producing low-quality code.

## Objectives

By completing this assignment, you will:

- Become familiar with TypeScript, VSCode, and the Covey.Town codebase
- Practice reading and writing TypeScript code
- Learn how to translate high-level requirements into working code
- Gain experience writing unit tests using Jest

- A webcomic has popularized a variant called Quantum Tic-Tac-Toe.
- Management wants this variant implemented in Covey.Town to attract users.
