What is testing?
  A test executes a given input on a program (the system under test or SUT) and compare the SUT's output to a given oracle

Building a test case

    You usually know the SUT
    You choose inputs
    Run the SUT on the chosen inputs to produce the output
    You choose the comparator
    You choose the oracle

Exhaustive testing is testing every input in practice this is rarely possible: input space is too large


How to write tests

Most common: exact match
  Also common:
    over-approximation (is the output one of these good values, or , more commonly , "is there any output at all")
    Under-approximation("does the output contain this expected value")
    But, could be an arbitrarily-complex boolean function
        must be boolean, because test needs to either pass or fail
